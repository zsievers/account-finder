## Github Finder

### About

<p class="lead"> I used context api, hooks, and Github's Api to search for github users. When searched for, the github user is pulled and brought in with a user component and a user items component inside of that. When clicked on more, react-router pulls in more data such as Name, Location, Bio, Profile, Repos and more.

The Context API to provided a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. </p>
